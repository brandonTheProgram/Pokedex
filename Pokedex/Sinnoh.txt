Flash Fire
Activates when user is hit by a damaging Fire-type move (including Fire-type Hidden Power). Once activated, user’s Fire-type moves deal 1.5 times damage. While this ability is in effect, this Pokemon is immune to damage from Fire-type attacks and Fire-type Hidden Power (accuracy and effect from these moves are ignored). For Fire-type Pokemon with this ability, Will-O-Wisp activates this ability without having an effect. If a non-Fire-type Pokemon has this ability, Will-O-Wisp will activate the ability and will have an effect.
Flame Body
The opponent has a 30% chance of being induced with Burn when using an attack, that requires physical contact, against this Pokémon.

# Pokedex

This was my first fun project that I created outside of my Computer Science class. This was created with the knowledge of what I learned in one semester of learning C++. This project is meant to emulate a Pokedex that a person would find inside the games or the show. All output that is generated from the program is sent to an output file name "OFile.txt", open that to see the results! An example of what the output looks like is displayed below using Charmander as an example.

# To Use

This project was created using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). Download the project and open up the "Debug" folder to find the application "Pokedex.exe" to run the program
